**Karate_club_graph_Modularity**

This project aims to find the hidden communities in a real world dataset( Zachary's Karate Club network) using spectral bipartition algorithm and doing it recursivly.

**The Story Behind**

Wayne W. Zachary, a graduate student in the early 1970s, spent two years studying friendships among 34 members of a university karate club in the United States. He recorded who interacted socially outside of class, creating a friendship network—now famous as the Zachary Karate Club graph. During his study, a conflict between the club’s instructor (Mr. Hi) and its administrator over how to use club funds caused the group to split into two rival factions. Remarkably, the friendships recorded before the breakup strongly predicted which side members chose. This makes the network a classic case for testing community detection: Can we infer the eventual split using only the structure of the friendship grap

Based on Newman's 2006 paper on modularity and community structure. Uses the classic Zachary Karate Club dataset from 1977.
